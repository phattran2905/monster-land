# Installation instructions
The project consists of two parts: __backend__ and __frontend__. Make sure you are in the folder while doing the installation.

## Frontend
Firstly, move to the folder with this command:
```cd frontend```

Next, install all the dependencies:
```npm install``` if you do not install __yarn__. Otherwise, use ```yarn install```.

Finally, run this command to start the development server:
```npm run dev``` or ```yarn dev```

## ___Note___
Since I did not use environment variables for the frontend, you might want to change the API server's URL when fetching data. Please go to ```redux/services``` and edit all the files fetching data from the API server.

For example: ```redux/services/authentication.js```
```javascript
...
// Replace the baseUrl with your local API server.
// baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: "https://monster-land-backend.vercel.app/api/v1/" })
baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: "http://localhost:2905/api/v1/" })
...
```

## Backend
Firstly, move to the folder with this command:
```cd backend```

Secondly, create a file named ```.env``` based on the ```.env-template``` file inside the folder. The ```.env``` file stores all the environment variables.

Next, install all the dependencies:
```npm install``` if you do not install pnpm. Otherwise, use ```pnpm install```.

Finally, run this command to start the development server:
```npm run dev``` or ```pnpm dev ```
